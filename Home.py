#     The **Essential Diagnostics project** aims to support Universal Health Coverage (UHC) 
#     by developing a rational and effective network of diagnostic services. This initiative is rooted
#     in the principles outlined in a comprehensive study focused on optimizing the availability
#     and utilization of essential diagnostic tests. The core objectives of the project include 
#     enhancing diagnostic capabilities across various levels of healthcare facilities, ensuring 
#     equitable access to critical diagnostic tests, and promoting the efficient use of resources 
#     to improve patient outcomes.

#     #### Key Highlights:
#     - **Rational Design:** The project emphasizes a systematic approach to designing diagnostic networks that align with the healthcare needs of different populations.
#     It involves identifying essential diagnostic tests that are critical for the effective management of common health conditions.

#     - **Health Facility Tiers:** The network design considers the capabilities and resources of different tiers of health facilities, from primary to tertiary care.
#     The goal is to ensure that each level of care has access to appropriate diagnostic tools, facilitating timely and accurate diagnoses.

#     - **Condition Levels and Diagnostic Needs:** The project categorizes health conditions based on their severity and diagnostic requirements.
#     This categorization helps in prioritizing the allocation of diagnostic resources and tailoring the network to address the most pressing health challenges.

#     - **Data-Driven Approach:** Leveraging data from various sources, the project aims to create a dynamic and adaptable diagnostic network.
#     Continuous monitoring and evaluation are integral to the project, ensuring that the network remains responsive to changing healthcare needs and emerging health threats.

#     - **Universal Health Coverage:** The ultimate aim of the project is to support UHC by making essential diagnostics accessible and affordable for all.
#     By improving diagnostic services, the project contributes to better health outcomes and reduces the burden of disease on communities.
